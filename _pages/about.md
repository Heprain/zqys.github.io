<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a master's Degree in computer science at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, China.

My research interests lie in Change Detection(CD), RGB-D Salient Object Detection(RGB-D SOD), and their application in diverse practical scenarios.

- We create an effective saliency enhanced feature fusion (SEFF) module, which uses the saliency maps to improve the representative ability of the fused features.
- Based on SEFF, we build a multiscale RGB-D saliency detector, which takes images with three different scales and generates high quality saliency results.
- We have conducted extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, which demonstrates that our method outperforms ten SOTA saliency detectors.

[ScaleMix: Intra- And Inter-Layer Multiscale Feature Combination for Change Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095962)

Rui Huang, **Qingyi Zhao**, Ruofei Wang, Caihua Liu, Sihua Gao, Yuxiang Zhang, Wei Fan

- We propose an inception difference module to conduct the intra-layer multiscale feature fusion.
- We propose a residual network refinement to capture inter-layer multiscale characteristics.
- Our method can consider both intra- and inter-layer multiscale characteristics simultaneously, which results in superior CD performance over other compared CD methods.
